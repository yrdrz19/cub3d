# cub3d
This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way.

## ðŸ§® Math Concepts

### Vectors

- Understanding 2D and 3D vectors

- Vector addition, subtraction, scaling

- Dot product (for angles, projections)

- Cross product (for normals, in 3D)

- Vector normalization and magnitude

### Geometry

- Points, lines, planes

- Angles and trigonometry (sine, cosine)

- Intersections (line-line, line-plane, line-box, etc.)

### Linear Algebra

- Matrices (for transformations)

- Coordinate transformations (world space, view space)

- Matrix-vector multiplication
